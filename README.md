## Why I created this App:
The reason I created this web application is to try out and gain experience with Vue.js, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and practice modern web techniques.

## Tech Stack:
- Vue.js
- AWS (Lambda, CloudWatch, API Gateway, Amplify, DynamoDB, IAM, S3)
- TypeScript
- GSAP
- Cypress

## What I learned:
- Vue.js as frontend.
- Amazon Web services as backend:
  - Created IAM accounts to and assign permissions/policies/roles.
  - Created Buckets for S3 to store images.
  - Created tables in DynamoDB to store objects (ex: recipe data).
  - Created and maintain backend logic, such as CRUD, in Lambda.
  - Created APIs' using API gateway to perform CRUD actions.
- Cypress to create tests and debug problems.
